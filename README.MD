# Vattenfall bookstore

## App overview
There is an application about books and authors. Code is written in java and Spring Boot 3.x. It uses gradle for dependency management.
App exposes one endpoint for getting information about the books and there is persistence layer but database is not configured 
(you can configure one if you need but is not required for achieving the goal).

## The goal
Unfortunately, app was written by not so experienced craftsmanship, so there is no tests. Your goal will be to configure project and write tests.
You can choose any testing library that you prefer (Spock+Groovy, Kotest+Kotlin, jUnit+Java). 
If you don't have any preferences you can pick Spock framework and write tests in Groovy. 
Feel free to adjust code if you need but remember main goal is to write tests and cover all important branches in the code.
It is up to you decide what kind and how much of test cases write, what tools or libraries use and so on. 
The goal is to have well tested bugs-free project.

## Why
You might ask why such task? So the reason is we in the team put strong emphasis on testing because we see big value in tests.
So reason is simple We would like to see if your approach to testing apps is similar to our :-)

## How to
Repository with project is available on github https://github.com/jgprogram/rekru-proj. 
If you have github account fell free to create fork with the repo and when task is done create PullRequest/MergeRequest from you fork to main repo.
If you don't have a github account, you can also clone the project, write the code archive it with zip and send it to the recruitment supervisor.
